# sonicWallBruteForce
Script to brute force logins to SonicWall

Based on gist by vasuman to do autologins

I don't have a sonic wall, or valid creds, so not fully tested. Please let me know if this isn't working as expected.

If it turns out this really does work, I'll focus on performance later. 

Wet paint for sure.
