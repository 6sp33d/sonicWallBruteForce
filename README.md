# sonicWallBruteForce
Script to brute force logins and password spray to SonicWall

Based on gist by vasuman to do autologins
https://gist.github.com/vasuman/fa750a6fe57fc8a73aff


I don't have a sonic wall, or valid creds, so not fully tested. Please let me know if this isn't working as expected.
The search strings to detect a successful login are based on seeing other people's code, not access to
a sonicwall and valid creds. 

If it turns out this really does work, I'll focus on performance later. 

SonicWall can be pretty IP blocking happy. Consider using the HTTP proxy feature to pass
this through Burp, and use IPRotate extension to snag a new source IP for every request.

Wet paint for sure.
